## What it does
A simple implementation of a CI/CD pipeline for Databricks using **`GitHub Actions`** & **`Databricks Workflows`**. <br>
The pipeline is triggered when a new commit is pushed to selected branches. <br>
<br>
The pipeline consists of the following steps:
* **Push** <br>
    Pushes the code to the Databricks workspace and runs unit and integration tests.

* **Release** <br>
    If the tests pass on the staging environment, the code is released to the production environment.
<br>

## Requirements
* **__Databricks__** workspace
* Link between **__Databricks__** workspace and **__GitHub__** account
* **__GitHub secrets__** for:
    * Databricks URL
    * Databricks token
